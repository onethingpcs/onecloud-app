Description: # Overview
        
        This is a Python v3.2+ (and 2.7+) [Universal Binary JSON](http://ubjson.org) encoder/decoder based on the [draft-12](UBJSON-Specification.md) specification.
        
        
        # Installing / packaging
        ```shell
        # To get from PyPI
        pip3 install py-ubjson
        
        # To only build extension modules inline (e.g. in repository)
        python3 setup.py build_ext -i
        
        # To build & install globally
        python3 setup.py install
        
        # To skip building of extensions when installing (or building)
        PYUBJSON_NO_EXTENSION=1 python3 setup.py install
        ```
        **Notes**
        
        - The extension module is not required but provide a significant speed boost.
        - The above can also be run with v2.7+
        - PyPI releases are signed with the [Iotic Labs Software release signing key](https://iotic-labs.com/iotic-labs.com.asc)
        - At run time, one can check whether compiled version is in use via the _ubjson.EXTENSION_ENABLED_ boolean
        
        
        # Usage
        It's meant to behave very much like Python's built-in [JSON module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), e.g.:
        ```python
        import ubjson
        
        encoded = ubjson.dumpb({u'a': 1})
        
        decoded = ubjson.loadb(encoded)
        ```
        **Note**: Only unicode strings in Python 2 will be encoded as strings, plain *str* will be encoded as a byte array.
        
        
        # Documentation
        ```python
        import ubsjon
        help(ubjson.dump)
        help(ubjson.load)
        ```
        
        # Command-line utility
        This converts between JSON and UBJSON formats:
        ```shell
        python3 -mubjson
        USAGE: ubjson (fromjson|tojson) (INFILE|-) [OUTFILE]
        ```
        
        
        # Tests
        
        ## Static
        This library has been checked using [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) and [pylint](http://www.pylint.org), using a modified configuration - see _pylint.rc_ and _flake8.cfg_.
        
        ## Unit
        ```shell
        ./coverage_test.sh
        ```
        **Note**: This requires [coverage](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage).
        
        
        # Limitations
        - The **No-Op** type is not supported. (This should arguably be a protocol-level rather than serialisation-level option.)
        - Strongly-typed containers are only supported by the decoder (apart from for **bytes**/**bytearray**).
        - Encoder/decoder extensions are not supported at this time.
        
        
        # Why?
        The only existing implementation I was aware of at the time of writing ([simpleubjson](https://github.com/brainwater/simpleubjson)) had the following limitations:
        
        - Does not support efficient binary encoding
        - Only supports draft-9
        - Only supports individual Python types rather than anything implementing an interface (e.g. _Mapping_)
        - Does not decode nested arrays or objects in expected form
        - Lacks C extension speed-up
